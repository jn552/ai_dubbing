There are definitely some tricky parts, but overall I'm really enjoying the process. It feels great to gradually improve and get better at speaking and understanding it. I thought it would be fun to record a little sample for you all to hear how it sounds. Hopefully it comes across naturally and you can get a sense of where I'm at. Thanks so much for listening and supporting me. It means a lot.",
